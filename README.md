## Description

This This is a full-stack web application that allows user to view gently new and used furniture items.  The user is able to create a account and then log in. Once the user logs in they can view current listed items and add their own as well. They can edit their postings as well as delete. When the user clicks on the image of the furniture they are interested in the description appears as well as the contact information. It also allows users to enter a message that will be sent to the owner of the item. Users can also search for a specific item with the name or zip code of the area they are looking in.

## Technologies Used
Second Life app was built using Node.js, MongoDB, Express, Javascript, AngularJS, HTML/CSS.

## Approach Taken
Our inspiration for this app came from Offer Up. Which is a website built on the idea of craigslist but instead of being able to post anything to the site we wanted to limit it to only furniture. We began this project by first discussing some ideas then came to an agreement on one. From there we created a Trello board to create a detailed outline for what needed to be done in order to create our project on time. We also made it clear to use separate branches on github to push up for everyone to review code to make sure there were no merging conflicts before pushing to master. We then talked daily over zoom and slack to make sure we were all on track and on the same page. These minor things helped us immensely.

## Using the App
On the main page of the app it will show all listings available by newest to oldest. The create account and log in feature was created to make sure only the user who posts the item can edit and delete it. The search bar was added to help users sift through the items easier in there area and by name. The contact form/ message was designed for a better user experience, so the user can directly contact the seller in multiple ways. (not just by phone number incase the seller did not provide it)

## Unsolved problems
We did not have time to add more features. We would of liked to add a feature to be able to filter the items more.
